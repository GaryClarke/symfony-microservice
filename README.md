**symfony-microservice** is a tutorial repository for an [accompanying YouTube series][1].

Quick Setup
-----------
The tutorial development setup combines a local PHP installation with some containerized services running in Docker and requires that the [symfony cli tool][2] be installed.

To start the Docker services, run the following command:

```docker-compose up -d```

You can start the symfony development server using:

```symfony server:start -d```
